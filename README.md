# Towards Formal Verification of Deep Neural Networks for Object Detection.

This repository contains the artifact accompanying our FMCAD 2025 paper:

**Towards Formal Verification of Deep Neural Networks for Object Detection.**

## Repository Structure

```
├── abcrown/    # Extended version of alpha-beta-CROWN with OD/IoU verification functionality  
├── train/      # Pre-processing scripts (training models, etc.) and data preparation  
├── analyze/    # Post-processing and result analysis  
```

- **abcrown/**: Forked and extended version of [alpha-beta-CROWN](https://github.com/Verified-Intelligence/alpha-beta-CROWN), with added support for object detection and IoU verification.
- **train/** and **analyze/**: Contain pre- and post-processing utilities.
- The main entry point is [`abcrown/FVOD/verify_fc.py`](abcrown/FVOD/verify_fc.py), which demonstrates minimal example usage. You can customize arguments as needed.

## Data

Required data is automatically downloaded during the first run.

## Requirements

This artifact builds upon the [alpha-beta-CROWN](https://github.com/Verified-Intelligence/alpha-beta-CROWN) framework.  
Please follow their installation instructions.  
Our repository uses only modified pure-Python scripts and introduces no additional dependencies.
