# FVOD: Artifact for FMCAD 2025

This repository contains the artifact accompanying our FMCAD 2025 paper:

**Title:** Towards Formal Verification of Deep Neural Networks for Object Detection.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

```
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ abcrown/    # Extended version of alpha-beta-CROWN with OD/IoU verification functionality  
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/      # Pre-processing scripts (training models, etc.) and data preparation  
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analyze/    # Post-processing and result analysis  
 ```

- **abcrown/**: Forked and extended version of [alpha-beta-CROWN](https://github.com/Verified-Intelligence/alpha-beta-CROWN), adding support for object detection and IoU verification.
- **train/** and **analyze/**: Contain pre- and post-processing utilities.
- The main entry point is [`abcrown/FVOD/verify_fc.py`](abcrown/FVOD/verify_fc.py), which demonstrates minimal example usage. You can customize arguments as needed.

## üì¶ Requirements and Installation

This artifact builds upon the [alpha-beta-CROWN](https://github.com/Verified-Intelligence/alpha-beta-CROWN) framework. Our repository is based on the April 2024 release of alpha-beta-CROWN (commit `1a3533a`).

To set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository and checkout the specific commit:**

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/Verified-Intelligence/alpha-beta-CROWN.git
   cd alpha-beta-CROWN
   git checkout 1a3533a
   ```

2. **Create and activate the conda environment:**

   ```bash
   conda create -n alpha-beta-crown python=3.11 -y
   conda activate alpha-beta-crown
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r complete_verifier/requirements.txt
   ```
Our repository uses only modified pure-Python scripts and introduces no additional dependencies beyond those required by alpha-beta-CROWN.

After installing alpha-beta-CROWN, replace its source code with our modified version provided in the `abcrown/` folder of this repository.
